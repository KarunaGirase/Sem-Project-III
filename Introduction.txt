Problem Statement

Agriculture in the Dhule district is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as soil composition, rainfall patterns, temperature, and fertilizer usage. Farmers often struggle to make accurate decisions regarding which crop to grow, the suitable fertilizer to apply, and how changing climatic conditions will impact crop yield. Due to the lack of timely, scientific, and data-driven insights, these decisions are often based on assumptions, leading to reduced productivity and financial loss.
There is a need for a predictive system that helps farmers make informed decisions based on real data, improving crop selection, fertilizer management, and yield planning.

Objectives

To build a system that predicts the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental parameters.

To recommend the appropriate fertilizer based on soil nutrient levels and crop requirements.

To analyze rainfall data and study its impact on crop growth and productivity.

To provide farmers with a data-driven decision-making platform for effective and sustainable crop management.

Applications

Smart Agriculture: Helps farmers identify the best crop and fertilizer for higher yield and better resource utilization.

Decision Support System: Assists farmers in making informed and scientific farming decisions.

Resource Optimization: Ensures appropriate use of fertilizers, reducing cost and minimizing environmental harm.

Rainfall-Based Planning: Enables farmers to plan sowing, irrigation, and harvesting activities based on rainfall predictions.

Government/NGO Use: Useful for agricultural planning, policy-making, subsidy allocation, and district-level agricultural analysis.
