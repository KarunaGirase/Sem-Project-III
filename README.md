Problem Statement

Agriculture is highly dependent on environmental factors such as soil quality, rainfall, and fertilizer usage. Farmers often struggle to make informed decisions about which crop to grow, the right fertilizer to apply, and how rainfall patterns affect yield. Lack of timely and data-driven insights results in reduced productivity and income.

Objectives

To build a system that predicts suitable crops based on environmental and soil parameters.

To recommend the appropriate fertilizer for improving productivity.

To analyze rainfall and its impact on crop yield.

To provide farmers with a data-driven decision-making platform for effective crop management.

Applications

Smart Agriculture: Helps farmers choose the best crop and fertilizer for maximum yield.

Decision Support: Assists in making informed choices about farming strategies.

Resource Optimization: Ensures proper utilization of fertilizers, reducing cost and environmental harm.

Rainfall-Based Planning: Farmers can plan sowing and harvesting based on rainfall predictions.

Government/NGO Use: Useful for agricultural planning, subsidy distribution, and policy-making.
