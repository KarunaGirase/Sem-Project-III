Literature Survey
Background

Modern agriculture increasingly uses data-driven methods to improve crop selection, fertilizer use, and yield forecasting. Machine learning models (classifiers and regressors) trained on historical weather, soil (NPK, pH), and crop-yield data can recommend suitable crops, propose fertilizer treatments, and predict yield or rainfall impacts. These systems aim to reduce guesswork, optimize input usage (fertilizers, water), and improve farmer incomes while reducing environmental harm.

Systematic review of ML for crop yield prediction — van Klompenburg et al., 2020

What it is: A systematic literature review that collects and synthesizes algorithms, data types, and evaluation metrics used for crop yield prediction. It surveys classical ML and some deep-learning approaches and highlights common features (weather, soil, remote sensing).

Why relevant: Gives an overview of which predictors and models are commonly effective for yield forecasting and clarifies data and evaluation best practices. 
ScienceDirect

Crop Yield Prediction using data-driven ML (MDPI / Kuradusenge et al., 2023)

What it is: A comparative study that applies data-mining / ML models to predict yields (e.g., maize, potato) using weather and historical yield datasets.

Why relevant: Demonstrates practical model pipelines and feature engineering (weather aggregation, lag features) commonly used in applied crop-yield work. 
MDPI

Machine-learning based Crop Recommendation (Springer / Prity et al., 2024)

What it is: An applied study proposing ML models for crop recommendation using historical climate and soil property datasets; the paper discusses tailoring recommendations to local conditions.

Why relevant: Closely matches your project scope (crop recommendation based on soil and climate features) and covers model selection and evaluation for recommendations.

Practical open-source projects (e.g., Harvestify — GitHub)

What it is: Popular community projects on GitHub that combine crop-recommendation, fertilizer suggestion, and disease detection using ML models wrapped into Flask/Django web apps. They provide working code, dataset formats, and UI templates for deploying similar systems.

Why relevant: Useful as implementation references (how to structure CSV inputs, serve models via Flask, simple web UI flows) and for replicable engineering patterns.

Fertilizer recommendation reviews / applied studies

What it is: Recent reviews and applied articles proposing ML-based or rule-based fertilizer recommender systems that use soil nutrient levels (NPK), pH, and crop type to suggest fertilizer mixes or dosages. These studies discuss sustainability and soil-health tradeoffs.

Why relevant: Matches your project module fertilizer_recommendation.py and informs both the data features required and evaluation (soil improvement + yield impact)

Limitations of existing systems (common findings across literature and projects)

Data availability & quality — Many models depend on extensive, clean historical records (weather, soil tests, yield). In practice such records are noisy, sparse, or absent for smallholder farms, which degrades model accuracy. 
ScienceDirect

Regional generalization / localization problem — Models trained on one region or cropping pattern often do not generalize to different agro-ecological zones without retraining or local calibration. This requires region-specific data collection. 
SpringerLink

Lack of real-time sensor integration — Many published systems are offline (batch prediction) and don’t integrate live soil sensors or weather forecasts, limiting responsiveness to short-term conditions. Practical precision-agriculture needs IoT + streaming inputs. 
ScienceDirect
PMC

Explainability & farmer trust — Black-box ML models (deep learning/ensemble) may give accurate suggestions but lack interpretable explanations that farmers or extension officers can trust; explainability is an active research need. 
PMC

Economic & operational constraints omitted — Many systems focus purely on agronomic fit (which crop should be grown) but do not factor in market prices, farmer capital, labor availability, or input cost — all crucial for real adoption. Practical deployments must integrate socio-economic context. 
ScienceDirect

Overfitting & small sample sizes — Academic prototypes sometimes report high accuracy on small or curated datasets but overfit and perform poorly in real-world noisy deployments. Cross-validation and external validation are often under-reported. 
MDPI

Limited fertilizer-sustainability modeling — Some fertilizer recommenders suggest fertilizers to maximize short-term yield without modeling long-term soil health or environmental run-off effects; sustainable recommendations need crop rotations and soil-health constraints.
